## Model Training

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Required packages can be installed on **python3.6** environment via command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Nvidia GPU with Cuda 10.0 are required for training models.

### Data

A synethic data with same format in [data](https://github.com/anonymousforpaper/GNN_for_AD/blob/tree/master/data) folder:
  - **preprocess_x.pkl**: 1-d EHR data (num_of_patients * num_of_EHRs);
  - **y_bin.pkl**: AD outcomes in 12-24 months;
  - **frts_selections.pkl**: indices of features;
  - **train_idx.pkl, val_idx.pkl, test_idx.pkl**: indices of samples that belongs to train, validation or test sets;
  - **neg_young.pkl**: indices of young negative samples in training set to be downsampled;
  - **synethic_data_generator**: the detail format and method of generating synethic data.


### Train

GNN for EHR on predicting disease outcomes can be train by running command:

```
python3 train.py --input 512 --output 512 --heads 4 --batch 64 --dropout 0.4 --alpha 0.15 --lr 0.0001
```
